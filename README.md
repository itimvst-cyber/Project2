Second Chance Clothing — Static Landing Page

Contents:
- index.html — Landing page with Navbar, Hero, Features, Testimonials, Footer
- about.html — About / Team page
- css/style.css — Custom styles (pastel green theme)

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use your editor's Live Preview).
2. `about.html` is linked from the Navbar.

Notes:
- Uses Bootstrap 5, FontAwesome and Google Fonts via CDN.
- Replace placeholder images with real assets under `assets/` if desired.
- Color variable `--brand` in `css/style.css` controls the primary pastel green tone.

Adding your product photos
--------------------------
Place the product images you attached into the `assets/products/` folder and name them:

- `product1.jpg`
- `product2.jpg`
- `product3.jpg`
- `product4.jpg`

The product cards on `index.html` point to these files. If you prefer different filenames, update the `src` attributes in `index.html` accordingly.

Enjoy! :)
